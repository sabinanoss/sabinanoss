### ‚ú®I'm actively looking for a job in web development. I am open to Front-end web developer position.‚ú®

# About me üë©üèº

I am Sabina Nossov√°, a **Junior Front-end Web Developer** from Czech republic. 

In 2022, I graduated with a bachelor's degree of Theory of Interactive Media , where I tasted the world of programming for the first time in my life. From the beginning, I wasn't sure if it was for me, but after first week learning basics of HTML 5 and CSS 3  I fell in love with it immediately. 

To facilitate learning, I successfully completed a 3-month retraining course focused on JavaScript, Node.js, Responsive web design, Bootstrap and Manual testing. At the beginning of April 2023, I completed the Vue MasterClass on the Udemy platform. Therefore, I focus most on acquiring knowledge within the Vue.js framework. I am currently working on my projects to improve my skills.
