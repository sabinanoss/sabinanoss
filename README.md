# About me 👩🏼

I am Sabina Nossová, a **Junior Web Developer**. 

In 2022, I graduated with a bachelor's degree of Theory of Interactive Media , where I tasted the world of programming for the first time in my life. From the beginning, I wasn't sure if it was the field for me, but I love learning and trying new things in.
