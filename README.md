# About me 👩🏼

I am Sabina Nossová, a **Junior Web Developer** from Czech republic. 

In 2022, I graduated with a bachelor's degree of Theory of Interactive Media , where I tasted the world of programming for the first time in my life. From the beginning, I wasn't sure if it was the field for me, but after first week learning basics of HTML 5 and CSS 3  I fell in love with it immediately. 

To facilitate learning, I successfully completed a 3-month retraining course focused on JavaScript, Node.js, Responsive web design, Bootstrap and Manual testing. I am currently continuing to study frameworks and other technologies. see my learning timeline below.

# ✨I am also actively looking for a job in web development. I am open to FE or BE positions or Manual tester position.✨
